# Level10

#### Description

The setuid binary at **/home/flag10/flag10** binary will upload any file given, as long as it meets the requirements of the _access()_ system call.

To do this level, log in as the **level10** account with the password **level10**. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag10.

      memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
      sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
      sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(host);
      sin.sin_port = htons(18211);

      if(connect(fd, (void *)&sin, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)) == -1) {
          printf("Unable to connect to host %s\n", host);
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      ffd = open(file, O_RDONLY);
      if(ffd == -1) {
          printf("Damn. Unable to open file\n");
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      rc = read(ffd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
      if(rc == -1) {
          printf("Unable to read from file: %s\n", strerror(errno));
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      write(fd, buffer, rc);

      printf("wrote file!\n");

  } else {
      printf("You don't have access to %s\n", file);
  }
}

#### Solution

This program takes two arguments:

1. A file path
2. A host IP address

It then:

1. Checks if you can read the file (using `access`).
2. If yes, it opens a TCP socket to the given host on port 18211.
3. Sends a small banner message (`.oO Oo.\n`) to the host.
4. Reads the contents of the file (up to 4096 bytes).
5. Sends that file data over the network connection to the host.
6. Prints status messages along the way.

So, basically there is a a time-of-use to time-of-check or TOCTOU bug(Race condition). If we can swap out the file between the time-of-check and the time-of-use, we should be able to send token and read it's content.
